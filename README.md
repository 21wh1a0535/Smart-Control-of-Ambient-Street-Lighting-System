# Smart-Control-of-Ambient-Street-Lighting-System
This project implements an intelligent street lighting system that automatically adjusts light intensity based on ambient light levels and motion detection. Designed to improve energy efficiency and safety, the system uses sensors to dynamically manage street lights, reducing power consumption during low-traffic hours.
